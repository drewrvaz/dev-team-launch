 PROJECT NAME 

Dev-Team-Launch


## DESCRIPTION

To foster  better learning in a large group, users can be assigned to small teams to work on individual projects. Upon login, the user can change their profile, view current project/team assignments, create new projects/teams, and access other functions, such as selecting a random user.

This app implements a MERN stack, using MongooseDB, Express, Node and Apollo on the server side, plus React on the client side.  The deployed app is available at https://dev-team-launch.herokuapp.com.
